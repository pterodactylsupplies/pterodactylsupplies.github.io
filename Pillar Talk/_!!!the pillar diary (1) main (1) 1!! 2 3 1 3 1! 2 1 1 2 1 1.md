<p style="margin: 0;"><span style="color: hsl(114.6, 22.4%, 49%);">note:</span> The events surrounding "The Pillar" resist conventional explanation. What initially presented as a standard project or study course quickly unraveled into something far more complex—perhaps even extraterrestrial in its nature. My role within this operation remains unclear, much like the operation itself. The guidance of Misha Katz, a mentor whose methods and insights appear to draw from sources unknown to us, only deepened the mystery. I emerged from "The Pillar" irrevocably changed—my thoughts more fragmented, yet strangely, more focused. The line between the investigation and investigator blurred, leaving me to question not just what "The Pillar" was, but why I was drawn to it. The truth is out there, but whether I’ve glimpsed it or merely brushed against its shadow remains to be seen.</p>

*As this case study was written and prepared I faced the variety of technical issues, not seeing the forest behind the trees, I got caught up in those little cute technicalities unable to resolve some of them or give up or give in. There is this weird joy of doing something this unproductive and insignificant. However I am still going to present you this case study, which hopefully will be updated in a proper manner and filled with something that really matters. So may you visit me again and you might discover something new. I'm endlessly grateful to [Misha Katz](https://www.instagram.com/mish.katz/) for the whole experience which I'm unable to even comprehend just yet. And to my friends I was so lucky to meet you all. Thank you for your attention.*

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">July 18. Yesterday I thought it was the Tower of Babel, although it doesn't feel like that. I like to think that there was a strong wind and everyone got wound up, but it doesn't feel like that either. I think everyone was looking for somewhere to wind up. I was looking for a place to hide, as if that's how it should be. I pretended to be something that could be in this environment. I think this is an <abbr title="06 aug - I endlessly rejoice">inn</abbr> between nowhere and nowhere. Now I want to do a shot with a hurricane and a shot with rain. <sup>July 30th. Still like this choice.</sup><br>___<br>Sshhh, [23-Jun-24 17:39]<br>Mom irrigator</p>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;"><s>I think I'm confused.</s> <sup>(August 6 - I don't think so anymore)</sup>
<p><s>I think I'm confused.</s> <sup>I kind of like it, I get pleasure from drowning,</sup> and I want to pass it on. It gives me strength and joy. I like watching strangers quarrel. I feel cornered, but I don't think I'm an evil person. It's probably hard to untangle yourself if you like the tangled mess. Now I want to make a shot with a straightened out knot. I like tediousness.<br><sup>(August 6 - this paragraph was rewritten ? times)</sup></p>
<p>I think I like redundancy. But not thick. Monotony, filling, filling. Irritation, not suffering. I wouldn't want to <s>upset</s> anyone. Bewilderment, confusion.</p>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">It was decided before the project was announced. There’s a time loop going on. I thought long and hard that I really needed this, specifically from Misha. I think since last fall or winter for sure. But I was too shy to ask, I just kept thinking away. When it was announced, I <s>stared</s>, when the questionnaire appeared, I immediately started filling it out, but it almost destroyed me. I went through a dozen rounds of answering questions for myself, it was interesting, difficult, painful. Part of the difficulty was interpreting the questions, and part of it was probably hard to be honest. It's hard to untangle what means what, what relates to what, what doesn't relate to what, what is connected to what, what is not connected to what. Because everything is connected to everything.</p>
<p>The last few months have been hard with interpreting incoming messages.</div>

<p>An early memory, like a ball, like a drawn ball, like a shading ball, humming, approaching me, it is being shaded closer and closer. I am lying in bed, still in my first apartment, I am probably three years old, this is not a dream, not visual,it's like a spasm[^1], a sensation that is visualized. It's not scary, but it's unclear and impossible to explain.<br>A recurring memory.</p>
<p>They asked me what was hard about studying. I hate watching videos. I hate videos. But I like it when things move. And I love movies.</p>
<p>A still from a movie.</p>
<p><em></em>▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇ ▇▇▇▇, ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇.<br>.....................................</p></div>

###### 4.
<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">This is probably about the second questionnaire. I'm getting hung up on the lack of data, mostly perceiving it as a problem with my equipment.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm, confusion and vacuum.<br>Difficulty with interpretation.<br>I had to have an internal conversation to understand the essence of the questions.<br>I had to ask chatgpt how feelings differ from emotions, I kind of know, but this knowledge is not reinforced. I mainly use chatgpt to find out what is understood by something in general.<br>I fill it out slowly, without resistance, with interest, and with surprise that there is nothing inside.<br>They ask about their feelings and emotions. I have appropriated sensations, sensations, but not feelings. This helplessness, when you do not understand what you are being asked about, or you do not have an answer. How can this not be.<br>Now, after a few weeks, there are feelings too.<br>All sorts of bad things can also be ▇▇▇. I am happy and puffed up.</p>
<p>August 5, 24 - now we will set the year. This project has really spun me up, and nothing bad seems to be happening. A little less scared and a little more. Not living is scary, something else is scary. You also get tired.<br>By the way, there was a habit of identifying myself through not, here it did not work very well, and why by the way.</p>
<p>(will need to run everything through spell check)</p>
<p>June 27<br><em>"This is the beginning of the work on the project. It concerns those who have sorted out the questionnaire (▇▇▇▇▇://▇▇▇▇▇.▇▇▇/▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇9▇▇6). In theory, it should concern everyone. So please click the link."</em></p>
<p>I click, click.</p>
<p>Fear fear fer<br>The most difficult question about the motto. Why the motto it’s really life principles.<br>Well, it's entirely impossible, but I'll try.<br>Actually, I have a principle that I grew with my own hands: if you don't know what to do, don't do it. I don't know why I didn't write it, probably because of that.<br>It seemed like they weren't asking about that.<br>Abstinence.<br>Removed all references to intonation. I don't remember why.<br>I'm trying to get to the assigned emotions through childhood, as recommended - there's mostly the delight of vision, the sun, memories, how you look at something. That's why vision was put in the main line, I think that's wrong.<br>(August 6 - I'm annoyed by this psychologized language here)</p>
<p>They ask what you want to be remembered for, radically exclude all references to ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇. For example, I like long-winded movies.</p>
<p>They ask what you want to do - my eyes or me. Of course my eyes, that's me. It seems that it was just a lie.<br>(05 August 24 - this is such a constant threshold, by the way, that I would like to see and hear better)</p>
<p>This time I decided that I would listen to my eyes, let what I see be transmitted. It didn't work out, I think.</p>
<p>- 3 tomatoes<br>- ½ onion<br>- 100 ml milk<br>- 100 ml 10%  cream<br>- 1 tbsp flour<br>- 2 tbsp butter<br>- Salt to taste<br>- Ground black pepper to taste</p>
<p>On July 18, I talked to Misha about how I need to make a case. Well, if I do it this way, then yes.<br>Misha says I need to model things so that there are things. I'm not sure.<br>But I confuse the feeling of the path with laziness and exhaustion.</p></div>

###### THERE'S A HOLE HERE
###### 4a.
<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">In one of the questions I encounter an ideologically important one, I think it's important, I don't believe in outside politics. In general, not everything that doesn't suit you necessarily doesn't suit you. If I think it's important, then it will suit you.</p>
<p><strong>▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇-▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇, ▇▇'▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇.</strong><br>Well, I'm actually having fun with find and replace here, it's hard to resist.</p>
<p>(August 5 - I would actually like it to be green instead of orange, but for now it's orange)</p></div>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">There are some lost thoughts -<br>>July 8 - Revolution in New York<br>I was in some kind of heavy or turbid state, or cruel, aggressive, I don't remember, I thought that the pole needed to be destroyed, sawed up. I don't remember the details.<br>I remember the state of the revolution itself, the boring ideal state of the script.</p>
<p>July 25 -<br>><em>"Here the action suddenly resumes without warning, and it's the same scene again, which unfolds rapidly, always similar to itself."</em></p>
<p>You can (you can't)[^2] use this project as a reassembly - identify with it, and then leave it.</p>
<p>><em>"Most of the other things have already been mentioned. Let us mention them again: a white car without wheels, an iron cage for transporting wild animals in the subway, a bicycle, several archaic agricultural machines, namely a chaff cutter, a single-share plough and three wooden harrows with iron tips, two bright blue doors, still enclosed in their door frames and turning on their hinges, and finally a metal ladder placed vertically in one corner of the area and constituting a kind of observatory from which one can simultaneously observe both the space enclosed by the fence and the surrounding streets. At the top of the ladder is a television antenna connected to numerous devices scattered over the cobblestones (each of them occupies six squares) showing the same educational programme, which makes it possible to follow it along the entire route. One of these televisions, broadcasting an educational programme about black Africa, figured, as we have seen, in the description of the first act of torture. Finally, we note that in the more open areas of the stage there are such objects as a ten-liter can full of gasoline, a bundle of chains of the thickness used to tie up very large dogs, four cast weights weighing twenty kilograms each, with a large ring and a raised inscription certifying the exact value of their mass, nippers, a hammer, blacksmith's nails, a thick wooden grater of a cylindrical shape with very large holes, a green silk dress burned by an iron, two syringes for intravenous infusions, three medical gowns stained with blood, steel scissors, an iron ruler with sharp edges, a box with six bottles containing a bright red liquid, tweezers for removing hair, a notebook in a black moleskin cover, a felt-tip pen, twelve razor blades, a knitting needle, pins, etc."</em></p>

<p>>Sshhh, [27-Jun-24 15:19]<br>I'm thinking about the questionnaire. I could have thought about it for quite a long time (very much), and now I'm still thinking that I need (or should I) use this exercise to force my thoughtfulness as one of my fundamental qualities to be suppressed.</p>
<p>I restrained myself, <abbr title="message">didn't send it.</abbr><br>I'm sending, <abbr title="questionnaire">that </abbr>, a minute before the stream. Not happy, I wrote something untrue.</p>
<p>July 25 - rereading, I wrote something untrue, there's a lot missing, and what kind of words are these.<br>I wanted to look ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇, and to look like I understood the question. A normal desire.<br>Okay, I removed some. But I needed more shame, of course.</p></div>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">(I would never have chosen number 100 if I had a choice)</p>
<p>On July 1, I was discussing with a psychoanalyst my misunderstanding of the questionnaire........<br>Did he say that it should be like that? A memory lapse, okay.</p>
<p>A few days later, I began to feel the fullness that I had been missing for several months or years, with feelings, emotions. All sorts of <bad> ones too. It's nice to live like this, thank you.</p></div>

###### NOT THAT
<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;"><p>It's easier to use all sorts of <bad> stuff. Well, not the worst stuff.</p>
<p>I thought for a long time that the most unifying thing is stylistic perception. I still think so.<br>I need to ask Misha about his compromises.<br>Compromised.</p>
<p>I'm rereading the questionnaire, well, yes, I didn't get the intonation right. Totally wrong, not quite right.<br>pride, dignity, hubris and false pride <▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇></p></div>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;"><p>I went to take pictures, I like everything.</p>
<p>I remembered that I had taken pictures of the poles before. I remembered that I liked the excess, but what I found was not as excessive as I remembered. Maybe I didn't find it.</p>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;">For some reason I got it into my head that I need details, elements, and not a general idea, it's hard to change, but I'll try.</p>
<p>(July 30 - I don't remember now whether we tried, but I thought we tried)<br>You think that you need to try not to control, but to perceive, but you don't control anything anyway. Okay, not nothing.</p></div>

![[SUMMERCAMP-005-72 1.png]]
>Sshhh, [03-Jul-24 16:08]<br>I wanted to tell you how it's going. I go to take pictures and get excited, I can't stop, but as it turns out, I'm worried about the lack of reasons for details. I can't stop thinking about the main pole itself, everything changes depending on different ideas about what it is. I sit down to draw, but I don't draw what I just looked at. It's hard for me to think about the detail, instead I think about the pole itself or the frame again. It seemed to me that the task was the supposed details of the project, but I still think about the whole piece. I go to the photos and try to switch to the details. Then I see that what I drew was actually there. In general, it seems to me that something is hatching, maybe not what is needed, but it is hatching. I don't know where the idea that a technical drawing of the details was stuck in my head, maybe from the mention of plasticity or examples. It seems that I have several options that I would like to do, which I like, perhaps prematurely.<br>

###### and some sketches here?
<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;"><p>This project, calling for orderliness, since it exists at all, will turn out to be the most disordered nonentity. Well, I just liked the word nonentity. I didn't even think about insignificance at all.</p></div>

In one of the options, we find the two closest points and tie the wire to them, taking into account the distance and thickness of the supposed wires. In another option, we find pairs of the closest points in some acceptable maximum. In the third option, we simply put it on each point separately, not so exciting, but also suitable. I ended up using this option, I think.</p>

<p>Stumbling</p>
<p>I thought that I really don't like switching between tasks, I hate it when I have more than one task in my field, I get overloaded and get stuck. In fact, when you do something tightly and for a long time, you have to switch, if you can. <sup>(06 August - Have to, in the sense that you switch organically and gently)</sup> If you haven't been sucked into panic or struggle.</p>

<p>Sshhh, [04-Jul-24 22:13]<br>Yes, I clearly noticed that I am pulled towards organic things, towards machines and screws not so much (now), that is, they can be a part of the composition, but not as the main thing, probably.

And what were the two solutions?<br>When I think about the technical side, it begins to seem that this may threaten motion designer cliches. But this makes me want to do it even more, because I don’t imagine it as a cliche. (maybe in vain?). On the one hand, it could be a setup like a procedural task (I like to dig down, but I’m afraid to get trapped in it forever), on the other hand, it could be a complete fake and very dirty in general, including intersections and all sorts of garbage, and this will fall into the main idea of ​​such an obsessive scribbling of the infinite. Maybe even almost 2D or wireframe in general. Maybe try particles. At this point, it’s probably worth starting already and seeing what the resistance of the material will give, but this path is ineffective, perhaps I always fall for this, I wonder if I can choose some other path? I’m also thinking about where these paths come from, in my opinion they should grow directly from the pole, I don’t know, just from the inside or directly from its surface.</p></div>

Which on the one hand is very nice, on the other hand, it is unclear how all this will turn out now.</p>

<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 11:41]<br>My heart ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ unborn pillars</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 11:47]<br><em>With a ruthless hand, clean out all mannerisms.</em></p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 11:50]<br>That's when a good movie has a weak ending - it's a shame, so you need to choose good solutions.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 11:51]<br>Or good bad ones.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 11:51]<br>I don't like ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:11]<br>Well, we've finally reached Pepperstein minus Prigov Kabakov.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:26]<br>Some caterpillar of the intonation of the whole thing is maturing inside</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:27]<br>Here's where the parallel comes in: I'd like to write drier, or at least clean and dry it out, and the projects' results also need to be dried and cleaned out, so that they are light in weight.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:28]<br>Well, it's not necessary. The soul lies.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:28]<br>Dry it and it will be like a skeletal leaf.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:31]<br>Like tissue paper. Japanese rice paper. It was cool to print etching on thin rice paper. I had a printing press in Dilijan (August 5 - not Dilijan, I had it at home - ed.), maybe a photo is needed here. It has a large black shiny wheel. Oil-painted black. I don't like and don't want to do anything with my hands, except wash dishes and etching. I want to etch.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:32]<br>When you send Misha the case, I'll let you make a pillar.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:33]<br>I feel very embarrassed to show it. Let it be as it is.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:33]<br>I don't like the tone or something.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:34]<br>I'll tell you what I do: I scatter dots and spin the seed.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:35]<br>Morning glory seeds.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:36]<br>The pillars that never happened are knocking on my heart. I can't stand it.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:36]<br>I can't stand it.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 14:47]<br>I can feel the form somewhere.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:16]<br>I CAN'T STAND IT</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:16]<br>I can</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:23]<br>I'll spit this out ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ like a ball of wool. And I'll be bigger.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:27]<br>On the one hand, it's good to see, hear, understand and participate, on the other hand, it's not necessary. Look, I've already grown in size.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:27]<br>Diane, remind me about the checkerboard floor.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:28]<br>And I'm also thinking about the pile of poles that someone else didn't make.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:28]<br>A forest of poles.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:28]<br>I'm worried that this will look pretentious on a pole.</p>
<p>July 29 - long dash - August 5 - finally we have a joke here.</p>
<p>___<br>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:28]<br>Finally, sir, I was already worried.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 15:35]<br>I often imagined the project as a tangled mess, you start and wind it up.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 16:21]<br>There's still some space up there, you can write something or stick it on lightly (well, just barely). But I don't have the moral strength, among all the things I need or want to do, this doesn't fall into any category. But maybe it's necessary, maybe it will be a step up in the game? Step to the next level. To a better life. There is no internal push. Here are two (three) days to twist a knot that is not visible, there is, but there is no reason for this. What do you think?</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 17:13]<br>Maybe it is not going well because the solution is obvious, but maybe it added context, or rather strengthened it.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 17:13]<br>100 playblasts</p>

<div style="max-width: 40em; margin: 0 auto;"><p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 21:34]<br>I have been thinking for a long time why there are blockages in the shadows and in the light, after a few hours I noticed that there is a broadcast layer on top.</p>
<p>We used to think that broadcast designers were the highest caste, but soon it will be unclear who they will be.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 21:58]<br>I still decided not to render this necessary detail inside, I will give myself a way to retreat. Although it is a pity.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 21:58]<br>It seems no one wants to play with me.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 21:59]<br>The excruciating feeling of being naked. At the same time, of fickle courage.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [29-Jul-24 23:47]<br>Unabomber was logging his disguises</p>
<p>The lady with the log.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 00:31]<br>I can't remember the word. To harass. To drive to exhaustion. Begins with F.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 00:32]<br>TO FINISH</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 00:37]<br>I am enchanted, in love with the card index style. But</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 00:38]<br>I need a scanner</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 01:31]<br>Mom said I am too dependant on the cat</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 01:41]<br>I always wanted to do this meticulously detailed </p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 01:53]<br>Oh no. "17. The works of art that appeal to contemporary leftist intellectuals tend to reflect misery, defeat, and despair, or they take on a wild tone, throwing off rational control, as if there was no hope of realizing anything through rational thought, and whatever was thrown away must wallow in some momentary sensation."</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:03]<br>I live cut off from all these books, all these objects and it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:05]<br>Anyway, the composition either works or doesn't work, and here we need mass for the composition to work, maybe I can sacrifice some precision of detail finally, maybe I could admit that something doesn't matter, especially if it doesn't work out, but I have a small piece of wire covered with plastic.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:08]<br>At this point I lose my opinion about someone's poles. I am imbued with the idea that this is simply personal. But I feel less of a connection.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:11]<br>I also don't know what I think about the fact that most people's progress is jerky and abrupt. In most cases, I didn't foresee where things were going, or I foresaw it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:25]<br>I am slow, in order to have at least a somewhat acceptable pace, I have to lose sleep, life, and to overcome.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 02:27]<br>It seems that in order to maintain focus, I have to reduce rest and sleep. This damages quality and my judgment.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:12]<br>I realized that I am most interested in Stas Khrustalev's case<br>(August 5 - not only)</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:12]<br>Yes, it is possible that there will be text without pictures. That's where I came</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:17]<br>I understand their anxiety, people are scared and have nothing to rely on, they want to take up something old, I understand, I see it in my view of AI, suspicious conservatism, provoked by the inability to adapt, vulnerability, inflexibility, they want to lean on conservatism, I will try to stay with humanism, but this does not cover machines and I do not believe in the three laws.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:19]<br>We were wrong to be afraid that they would take our jobs, we will try to imitate them. Chewing over the chewed.</p>

<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:25]<br>God, now I'm worried that she's too cheerful. Or sweet. Lord.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:26]<br>There will be 4 threads here, ▇▇▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇, ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇, ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ ▇ ▇▇▇▇▇ ▇ ▇▇▇</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:45]<br>I think that I need to make an index card part. I need to try</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:46]<br>Sometimes you know right away what to do, sometimes you do the opposite.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:48]<br>Stas Khrustalev does everything for a reason</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:49]<br>At first there was a gap between the conceptual and the tactile, now everything is coming to together</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:51]<br>I'm afraid that Stas Khrustalev will beat me :)</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 03:53]<br>I always wanted to remember that I like Rustam's work.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 04:12]<br>You have to make a choice, the choice can be any, why is this important? This is also some kind of sickening pleasure, with ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ nausea.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 04:14]<br>Since this is an object with a large number of points, then everything is connected to everything, and everywhere the shortest path.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 16:30]<br>I'm afraid of a mocking look, the wrong intonation, to sound fake, pompous, conceit</p>

<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 16:31]<br>Ted Kozinski is just a white asshole, such a pity</p>
<p>Sshhh, [30-Jul-24 17:32]<br>What about the process itself? Rounder, more to the right. Or the verbal turns off, the consciousness turns off. When you have to turn it on, it means everything is bad.<br>(05 August - an unjustified statement - ed.)</p>

<p>Sshhh, [01-Aug-24 20:39]<br>One of my trophies just got blown to pieces. It's for the best: inside I found a crackling machine, a loud-speaking parrot, an interesting tincture, a wet crow's tail, a container of schadenfreude, diamond flour, a light speed limiter, a photo of a mast girl, and 12,345 gold.</p>
<p>Sshhh, [01-Aug-24 21:58]<br>I'm upset that someone removed the heart from my pole. And let whoever did it read this in my case and be ashamed.</p>

<p>August 5 - everything is calm in Volgograd (I asked for news - they gave me news)<br>(update - it's not calm in Volgograd)</p>

<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 00:53]<br>I want to be Mr. Mole</p>
<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 00:54]<br>I'm so tired I want to be Mr. Mole. Sits and scurries and there's no need to manifest</p>
<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 00:58]<br>I remember those times when you could afford to be depressed, then those times when you wanted to get depressed, well, to rest or something. Now I don't know what time it is</p>
<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 00:58]<br>I'll allow it, but what can you do to me</p>
<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 01:28]<br>I wanted to write that the case is still flowing, I felt I wasn't ready to finish the case, it's still going ▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇ ▇▇▇▇▇. While I was opening it to write, I realized that I could let it go. Even so. But I can't let it go. Please say something about this? I</p>
<p>Sshhh, [02-Aug-24 01:29]<br>I was mostly worried about time, that it wasn't there. But lately I've been feeling some kind of calm</p>

<p>Sshhh, [27-Jul-24 19:30]<br>Procedural, adjusts to thickness, distance and position. But everything is not super smooth of course. A million options that I won't be able to tell apart in ten minutes. I can't stop redoing it. My most common situation. I think there are 3 (4) options - 1. Decide that it's good (normal, enough) and stop. 2. Decide that it's bad and quit altogether. 3. Decide that something specific can and should be improved as much as possible and do it. 4. ?. But I just pick and pick and pick and pick and pick and pick and pick. What do you think about that?</p>

God made this dungeon narrow as a punishment for those who did not want to submit to His laws. In earthly prisons the poor prisoner is left, at least freedom of movement, whether within the four walls of a cell or in the gloomy prison yard. It is quite different in hell. There is such a huge crowd of condemned people that the prisoners are squeezed into this terrible dungeon, the thickness of the walls of which reaches four thousand miles, and they are squeezed so strong and so helpless that, as the blessed saint, Saint Anselm, says in his book on similitudes, they cannot even remove the worms that gnaw at their eyes."</em><br>Sshhh, [05-Aug-24 23:50]<br>><em>"But all that I have said about the fury, properties and infinity of this flame is nothing compared to the power inherent in it as an instrument of the divine will, punishing the soul and body. This fire, generated by the wrath of God, does not act by itself, but as an instrument of divine retribution. As the water of baptism cleanses the soul together with the body, so the punishing fire tortures the spirit together with the flesh. Each of the bodily senses is subjected to torment, and the soul suffers along with them. Sight is punished by absolute impenetrable darkness, smell - by the most vile stench, hearing - by howling, groans and curses, taste - by fetid, corpse-like rot, indescribable fetid filth, touch - by red-hot nails and rods, merciless tongues flame. And amidst all these torments of the flesh, the immortal soul in its very nature is subjected to eternal torment by innumerable tongues of flame, kindled in the abyss by the angry majesty of Almighty God and fanned by the wrath of His breath into an ever-furious, ever-increasing flame."</em></p>
